And it was in the days of the justice-doing of the Just-Ones, 
and famine was in the land; 
and a man walked from the House of Bread (Bethlehem) Praise (Judah), 
to sojourn in the fields of From-Father (Moab); 
he and his woman and the two of his sons.

And the name of the man, God-My-King (Elimelech), 
and the name of his woman, My-Pleasant (Naomi), 
and the name of the two of his sons, Sickness (Mahlon) and Wasting (Chilion); Fruitful-Ones (Ephrathites) from the House of Bread (Bethlehem) Praise (Judah), 
and they came the fields of From-Father (Moab) 
and were there.

And My-God-King (Elimelech) the man of My-Pleasant (Naomi) died, 
and she was left, and the two of her sons.

And they lifted to them women Moabite-Women, 
the name of the one Neck (Orpah) 
and the name of the second Friend (Ruth), 
and they sat there like ten years.

And also the two of them Sickness (Mahlon) and Wasting (Chilion) died; 
and the woman was left, from the two of her children and from her man.

And she and her daughters-in-law stood-up 
and returned from the fields of From-Father (Moab), 
that she had heard in the field of From-Father (Moab) 
that He-Who-Is (YHWH) had visited his people 
to give to them bread.

And she went-out from the place which she had been there, 
and the two of her daughters-in-law with her, 
and they walked in the way to return to the land of Praise (Judah).

And My-Pleasant (Naomi) said to the two of her daughters-in-law, 
"Go return, woman to the house of her mother; He-Who-Is (YHWH) make with you steadfast-love as which you made with the dead and with me."

He-Who-Is (YHWH) give to you, and find rest, woman the house of her man." 
And she kissed to them, and they lifted their voice and wept.
