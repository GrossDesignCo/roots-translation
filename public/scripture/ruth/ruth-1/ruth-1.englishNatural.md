And it was in the days of the justice-doing of the Just-Ones, 
and famine was in the land; 
and a man walked from the House of Bread (Bethlehem) Praise (Judah), to sojourn in the fields of From-Father (Moab), he and his woman and the two of his sons.

And the name of the man God-My-King (Elimelech) and the name of his woman My-Pleasant (Naomi) and the name of the two of his sons Sickness (Mahlon) and Wasting (Chilion), Fruitful-Ones (Ephrathites) from the House of Bread (Bethlehem) Praise (Judah), 
and they came the fields of From-Father (Moab) and were there.

And My-God-King (Elimelech) the man of My-Pleasant (Naomi) died, and she 
was left, and the two of her sons.

And they lifted to them women Moabite-Women, the name of the one Neck (Orpah) and the name of the second Friend (Ruth), 
and they sat there like ten years.

And also the two of them Sickness (Mahlon) and Wasting (Chilion) died; 
and the woman was left, from the two of her children and from her man.
