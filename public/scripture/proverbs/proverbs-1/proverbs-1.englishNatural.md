king of Struggles-with-God (Israel).

To know Wisdom and Discipline; 
To understand words of understanding.
To receive discipline, wise-conduct; 
righteousness, and justice, and uprightness.

To give to simple men, shrewdness; 
to a young man, knowledge and purpose.
A wise man will hear, and will add teaching; 
and an understanding man, will acquire wise-counsels. To understand a rule and the interpretation; 
words of wise men and their sharp-sayings.

Fear of He-Who-Is (YHWH), heading of knowledge; 
Wisdom and discipline fools despise.
