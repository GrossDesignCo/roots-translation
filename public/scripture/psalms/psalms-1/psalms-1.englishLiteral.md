Blessed-is the-man, 
which not has-walked in-counsel-of wicked_ones, 
and-in-way-of sinners not has-stood, 
and-in-seat-of scoffers not has-sat.

That if in-law-of He_Who_Is (YHWH) his-choice_thing, 
and-in-his-law he-meditates by-day and-night.

And-he-will-be as-tree planted over channels-of waters; 
which its-fruit it-gives in-its-season, and-its-leaf not it-withers, 
and-all which he-makes, it-prospers.

Not so the-wicked, 
that if as-chaff which it-drives_away-it wind.

Over so not they-will-stand_up wicked-ones in-justice; 
and-sinners, in-assembly-of righteous-ones.

That knowing He-Who-Is (YHWH) way-of righteous-ones, 
and-way-of wicked-ones it-will-perish.
