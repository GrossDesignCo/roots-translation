Blessed is the man, 
which has walked not in the counsel of wicked-ones, 
and in the way of sinners has stood not, 
and in the seat of scoffers has sat not.

That if in the law of He-Who-Is (YHWH) his choice-thing, 
and in his law he meditates by day and night.

And he will be as a tree planted over channels of waters; 
which gives its fruit in its season, and its leaf withers not, 
and all which he makes, it prospers.

Not so the wicked, 
that if as chaff which the wind drives-away.

So moreover the wicked will stand-up not in justice; 
and sinners, in the assembly of the righteous.

That He-Who-Is (YHWH) knows the way of the righteous, 
and the way of the wicked will perish.
