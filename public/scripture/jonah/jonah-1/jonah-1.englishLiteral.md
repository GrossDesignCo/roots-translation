And-was word-of He_Who_Is (YHWH) to- Dove (Jonah) son-of My_Truth (Amittai), to-say;

"Stand_up, go to- Dwelling_of_Fish (Nineveh), the-city, the-great; 
and-call_out over-her, that- went_up bad-their before-my-faces."

And-stood_up Dove (Jonah), to-flee golden_stone (Tarshish), 
from-faces-of He_Who_Is (YHWH), 
and-went_down Beautiful (Joppa); 
and-found ship going golden_stone (Tarshish); 
and-gave fare-her, 
and-went_down in-her, to-go with-them golden_stone (Tarshish), 
from-faces-of He_Who_Is (YHWH).

And-He_Who_Is (YHWH) hurled wind- great to- the-sea, 
and-was tempest- great in-sea, 
and-the-ship planned to-be-broken.

And-feared the-sailors, and-cried_out, man to- gods-his, 
and-hurled ↳ the-vessels which in-ship to- the-sea, 
to-lighten from-over-them.

And-Dove (Jonah) went_down to- far_reaches-of the-ship; 
and-lay_down and-deeply_tranced.

And-came to-him chief the-sailor, 
and-said to-him, "What- to-you sleeper? Stand_up, call_out to- gods-your.

Perhaps will-think_upon the-Gods to-us, and-not perish."

And-said man to- friend-his, "Go, 
and-let-us-cause-to-fall lots, 
and-let-us-know for-whose-sake the-bad this to-us."

And-they-caused-to-fall lots, and-fell the-lot over- Dove (Jonah).

And-said to-him, "Tell- us to-us, in-which, for-who- the-bad this to-us; 
What- work-your? and-from-where you-come? 
What land-your? and-where- from-this people you?"

And-said to-them, "Passes_Through (Hebrew) I; 
and-↳ He_Who_Is (YHWH) Gods-of the-skies I fear, 
which- made ↳ the-sea and-↳ the-dry_ground."

And-feared the-men fear great, 
and-said to-him, "What- this you-did?" 
that- knew the-men, that- from-faces-of He_Who_Is (YHWH) he fleeing, that he-declared to-them.

And-said to-him, "what- shall-be-done to-you 
and-will-quiet the-sea from-over-us? 
that the-sea walking and-storming."

And-said to-them, "lift_up-me and-hurl-me to- the-sea; 
and-will-quiet the-sea from-over-you; 
that knowing I that for-sake-my the-tempest, the-great, the-this over-you."

And-rowed the-men to-return to- the-dry_ground; 
and-not they-were-able; 
that the-sea walking and-storming over-them.

And-called_out to- He_Who_Is (YHWH) and-said, 
"please He_Who_Is (YHWH), not- please let-us-perish in-throat-of the-man the-this; 
and-not- give over-us blood innocent; 
that- you He_Who_Is (YHWH), as-which you-delighted you-made.

And-lifted_up ↳ Dove (Jonah) and-hurled-him to- the-sea; 
and-stood the-sea from-rage-its.

And-feared the-men fear great ↳ He_Who_Is (YHWH); 
and-sacrificed- sacrifice to-He_Who_Is (YHWH) 
and-vowed vows.

And-appointed He_Who_Is (YHWH) fish great to-swallow ↳ Dove (Jonah); 
And-was Dove (Jonah) in-bowels-of the-fish 
three days and-three nights.
