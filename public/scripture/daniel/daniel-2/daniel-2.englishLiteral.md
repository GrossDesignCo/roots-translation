you king-the thoughts-your over bed-your they-came-up, what which to-be after this, and-revealer-the mysteries-the he-caused-you-to-know what which to-be.

and-I not in-wisdom which there-is-in-me from all living-the, mystery-the this he-revealed to-me, but on-word-of which interpretation-the to-king-the they-will-make-known, and-thoughts-of heart-your you-will-know.

you the-king seeing you-were and-behold image one great, image-the that great and-brightness-its surpassing, standing_up before-you, and-appearance-its fearsome.

he image-the head-its which gold good, breast-its and-arms-its which silver, belly-its and-thighs-its which bronze legs-its which iron, feet-its from-them which iron and-from-them which clay.

seeing you-were until which was-cut-out stone which not in-hands, and-struck to-image-the over feet-its which iron-the and-clay-the, and-crushed them.

in-then they-were-crushed as-one iron-the clay-the bronze-the silver-the and-gold-the, 
and-they-became like-chaff from threshing_floors-of summer, 
and-carried-them wind-the, and-all place not was-found to-them. 
and-the-stone that struck to-the-image became to-mountain great, and-filled all land-the.

this dream-the, and-interpretation-its we-will-tell before king-the.

you king-the king-of kings-the which God-of skies-the kingdom-the power-the and-strength-the and-glory-the he-has-given to-you.

and-in-all which dwelling sons-of mortal_man-the beasts-of field-the and-birds-of skies-the he-gave in-hand-your and-caused-you-to-rule in-all-them, you he head-the which gold-the.

and-after-you will-stand_up kingdom another lower from-you, and-kingdom third another which bronze-the, which will-rule in-all land-the.

and-kingdom fourth will-be strong-the like-iron-the, all because which iron-the crushing and-shatters all, and-like-iron-the which breaking all it-will-crush and-will-break.

and-which you-saw feet-the and-toes-the from-them clay-of potter and-from-them iron, kingdom divided-the will-be, and-from firmness-the which iron-the will-be in-it, all because which you-saw iron-the mixed in-clay mud-the.

and-toes feet-the from-them iron and-from-them clay, from- end-of kingdom-the will-be strong-the, and-from-it will-be fragile-the.

and-which you-saw iron-the mixed in-clay mud-the, mixing-themselves to-be-them in-seed mortal_man-the, and-not- to-be-them adhering this with- this. Behold just_as iron-the not mix-itself with- clay-the.

and-in-days-their which kings-the those he-will-raise_up God-the skies-the kingdom which to-the_ages not will-be_damaged, and-kingdom-the to-people another not will-be-left, and-she-will-crush and-she-will-consume all- these kingdoms-the, and-she will-stand_up to-the_ages.

all- because which you-saw which from- mountain-the was-cut-out stone which not in-hands, and-crushed iron-the bronze-the clay-the silver-the and-gold-the, God-the great he-made_known to-king-the what which to-be after this, and-certain dream-the, and-trustworthy interpretation-its."

then king-the Nebuchadnezzar fell over- face-his, and-to-My_Judge_God (Daniel) he-prostrated, and-offering and-soothing_aromas he-said to-pour_out to-him.
