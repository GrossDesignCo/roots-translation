And these are the birthings of the sons of Rest (Noah):
Name (Shem), Hot (Ham), and Spacious (Japheth);
and to them were birthed sons, after the flood.

And Black (Kush) birthed Rebel (Nimrod);
he caused to begin to be a mighty-one in the land.

He was a mighty-one of the hunter to the face of He-Who-Is (YHWH);
so moreover it will be said,
"Like Rebel (Nimrod), a mighty-one, a hunter to the face of He-Who-Is (YHWH)."

and the heading of his kingdom was Confusion (Babylon),
and Length (Erech), and Fortress (Akkadia), and Fortress (Calneh),
in the land of Tooth-of-Two (Shinar).

from that land brought-out Steppe (Assyria), 
and he built Dwelling-of-Fish (Nineveh)
and Open-Places (Rehoboth) City and Vigor (Calah), and Bridle (Resen), 
between Dwelling-of-Fish (Nineveh) and between Vigor (Calah); 
this, The City, The Great.
