And God blessed Rest (Noah) and his sons;
and said to them, 
"Be-fruitful and multiply and fill the land.

And your awe and your dread will be over all the living of the land
and over all the flyer of the skies,
in all which creeps the soil
and in all fish of the sea;
in your hand they are given.

All creeper which it is living, to you will be for food;
like the green of herb, I have given all to you.

Only flesh, in its wind, its blood, you will eat not.

And only your blood for your winds I will require;
from the hand of all living-being I will require it;
and from the hand of the Earth (Adam),
from the hand of a man his brother
I will require the soul of the Earth (Adam).

One-pouring the blood of the Earth (Adam),
in Earth (Adam) his blood will be poured;
for in the image of God, he made the Earth (Adam).

And you, be-fruitful and multiply,
swarm in the land, and multiply in it."

And God said to Rest (Noah), 
and to his sons with him, saying,

"And I, behold me, causing to stand-up, my covenant with you, 
and your seed after you;
and all the wind of the living-being which is with you;
in the flyer, in the beast, and in all the living-being of the land with you,
from all the going-out of the ark, to all the living-being of the land;
and I will cause to stand-up my covenant with you,
and not will be cut all flesh again from the waters of the flood,
and not will be again a flood to corrupt the land.

And God said, "This, the sign of the covenant which I am giving,
between me and between you,
and between all the wind of the living-being which is with you,
to the generations of the-age;
My bow I have given in the cloud,
and it will be for the sign of covenant,
between me and between the land.

And Rest (Noah) lived after the flood,
three hundred years and fifty years.

And all the days of Rest (Noah) were nine hundred years and fifty years,
and he died."
