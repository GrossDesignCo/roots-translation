And-blessed Gods ↳ Rest (Noah) and-↳ his-sons;
and-said to-them, 
"Be_fruitful and-multiply and-fill ↳ the-land.

And-awe-your and-dread-your will-be over all- living-of the-land
and-over all- flyer-of the-skies,
in-all which it-creeps the-soil
and-in-all- fish-of the-sea;
in-hand-your they-are-given.

All- creeper which it- living, to-you will-be for-food;
like-green-of herb, I-have-given to-you ↳ all.

Only- flesh, in-its-wind, its-blood, not you-will-eat.

And-only ↳ your-blood for-your-winds I-will-require;
from-hand-of all- living_being I-will-require-it;
and-from-hand-of the-Earth (Adam),
from-hand-of man his-brother
I-will-require ↳ soul-of the-Earth (Adam).

One-pouring blood-of the-Earth (Adam),
in-Earth (Adam) his-blood it-will-be-poured;
for in-image-of Gods, he-made ↳ the-Earth (Adam).

And-you, be_fruitful and-multiply,
swarm in-land, and-multiply- in-it."

And-said Gods to- Rest (Noah), 
and-to- his-sons with-him, to-say,

"And-I, behold-me, causing-to-stand_up, ↳ my-covenant with-you, 
and-↳ your-seed after-you;
and-↳ all- wind-of the-living_being which with-you;
in-flyer, in-beast, and-in-all- living_being-of the-land with-you,
from-all going-out-of the-ark, to-all living_being-of the-land;
and-I-will-cause-to-stand_up 
↳, my-covenant with-you,
and-not- it-will-be-cut all- flesh again from-waters-of the-flood,
and-not- it-will-be again flood to-corrupt the-land.

And-said Gods, "this, sign-of the-covenant which- I giving,
between-me and-between-you,
and-between all- wind-of living_being which with-you,
to-generations-of the_age;

↳ my-bow I-have-given in-cloud,
and-she-will-be for-sign-of covenant,
between-me and-between the-land.

And-lived- Rest (Noah) after the-flood,
three hundreds year and-fifty year.

And-were all- days-of- Rest (Noah) nine hundreds year and-fifty year,
and-he-died."
