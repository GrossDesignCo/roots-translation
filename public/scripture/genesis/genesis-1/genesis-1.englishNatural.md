In the heading, God created the skies and the land.

And the land was waste and void; 
And darkness, over the face of the abyss.
And the Wind of God, stirring over the face of the waters.

And God said, "Let light be."
And light was.

And God saw the light, that it was good. 
And God separated between the light, 
and between the darkness.

And God called-out to light, "Day,"
and called-out to darkness, "Night."

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
One day.

And God said, "Let a hammering-out be in the midst of the waters,
and let it be separating between waters and waters."

And God made the hammering-out, 
and separated between the waters which were under the hammering-out, and between the waters which were over the hammering-out. 
And it was so.

And God called-out to the hammering-out, "Skies."

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
A second day.

And God said, "Let the waters gather from under the skies to one place. And let the dry-ground be seen."
And it was so.

And God called-out to the dry-ground, "Land,"
and to the gathering of the waters he called-out, "Seas."
And God saw, that it was good.

And God said, "Let the land tenderly-shoot-up tender-shoot, herb seeding seed, fruit tree making fruit after its kind, which has its seed in it, over the land." 
And it was so.

And the land brought-out tender-shoot, herb seeding seed after its kind, and tree making fruit which has its seed in it after its kind. 
And God saw, that it was good.

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
A third day.

And God said, "Let there be light-sources in the hammering-out, the skies, to separate between the day, and between the night, 
And they will be for signs, and for appointed-times, and for days, and years.
And they will be for light-sources in the hammering-out, the skies, to shine-light over the land. 
And it was so.

And God made two, the light-sources, the greats, 
the light-source the great, for the ruling of the day, 
And the light-source the small, for the ruling of the night, 
And the stars.

And God put them in the hammering-out, the skies, to shine-light over the land.
And to rule in the day, and in the night, 
and to separate between the light, and between the darkness, 
And God saw, that it was good.

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
A fourth day.

And God said, "Let the waters swarm with a swarm, living throat, 
And let flyer fly over the land, over the face of the hammering-out, the skies."

And God created the monsters, the greats, 
And all throat the living the crawling which swarmed the waters, to their kind, 
And all winged flyer to its kind, 
And God saw, that it was good.

And God blessed them, saying, 
"Be-fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, 
And let the flyer multiply in the land."

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
A fifth day.

And God said, "Let the land bring-out living throat, to its kind, beast, and crawler, and living-being of land."

And God made, living-being of the land, to its kind, 
And the beast, to its kind, 
And all crawler the earth, to its kind, 
And God saw, that it was good.

And God said, "Let us make Earth (Adam), in our image, as our likeness, 
And let them subjugate, in fish of the sea, and in flyer of the skies, and in the beast, and in all the land, and in all the crawler, the crawling, over the land."

And God created the Earth (Adam), in his image,
in the image of God, created him, 
male and female, created them.

And God blessed them, 
And God said to them, "Be-fruitful and multiply and fill the land, 
And conquer and subjugate in fish of the sea, and in flyer of the skies, and in all the crawling living thing over the land."

And God said, "Behold, I give to you all herb seeding seed, which over the face of all the land, 
And all the tree which in it is fruit of tree seeding seed, to you it shall be for food.
And to all living-being of the land, and to all flyer of the skies, and to all crawler over the land, which in it is living throat: all green herb for food." 
And it was so.

And God saw, all which was made, 
And behold, very good.

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
The sixth day.
