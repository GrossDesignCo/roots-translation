And all the land was, one lip and of one words.

And it was in their journeying from the east, 
and they found a plain in the land of Tooth-of-Two (Shinar) 
and they settled there.

And they said, man to his friend, 
"Come let us make-bricks bricks and let us incinerate to an incinerating." 
And the brick was to them for stone, 
and the bitumen was to them for mortar.

And they said, "Come let us build for us a city and a tower 
and its head in the heavens, 
and let us make for us a name 
lest we are scattered over the face of all the land."

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) descended to see the city 
and the tower which the sons of the Earth (Adam) had built.

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said, 
"Behold, the people is one 
and one lip to all of them,
and this, the beginning of their making; 
and now nothing will be restrained from them, 
all which they will plan to make.

Come let us descend, 
and let us confuse there the lip of them,
which man will hear not the lip of his friend."

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) scattered them from there 
over the face of all the land;
and they ceased to build the city. So moreover he called the name of it Confusion (Babylon),
that there He-Who-Is (YHWH) confused the lip of all the land;
and from there He-Who-Is (YHWH) scattered them over the face of all the land.
