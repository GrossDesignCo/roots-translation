After these words,
the word of He-Who-Is (YHWH) was to Exalted-Father (Abram) in the vision, saying, 
"You will fear not Exalted-Father (Abram),
I, a shield to you;
your reward to multiply exceedingly."

And Exalted-Father (Abram) said, "Lord, He-Who-Is (YHWH),
what will you give to me?
And I walk childless,
and the son of possessor of my house is Damascus God-My-Help (Eliezer)."

And Exalted-Father (Abram) said, "Behold to me you have given not seed;
and behold the son of my house inherits me."

And behold the word of He-Who-Is (YHWH) came to him,
saying,
"Not will inherit you this;
but he which will come out from your bowels, he will inherit you."

And he brought out him outside, said, "Look now toward the heavens,
and count the stars if you are able to count them."
And he said to him, "Thus will be your seed."

And he believed in He-Who-Is (YHWH);
and he counted it to him as righteousness.

And he said to him,
"I, He-Who-Is (YHWH), which brought-out you from Ur of the Chaldeans,
to give to you this land to inherit it."

And he said, "Lord, He-Who-Is (YHWH),
by what will I know that I will inherit it?"

And he said to him,
"Take to me a heifer three years old,
and a goat three years old,
and a ram three years old,
and a turtledove, and a young pigeon."

And he took to him all these,
and divided them in the midst,
and gave man piece of him to meet his friend;
and the birds he divided not.

And the birds-of-prey descended over the carcasses,
and Exalted-Father (Abram) caused-to-return them.

And the sun was to come,
and a deep-trance fell over Exalted-Father (Abram);
and behold terror, great darkness, falling over him.

And he said to Exalted-Father (Abram), 
"Knowing you will know, that your seed will be a sojourner in a land not to them, and they will serve, 
and they will afflict them four hundred years."

And also the nation which they will serve, I will judge; 
and after so they will come out with great substance.

And you will go to your fathers in peace;
you will be buried in good old age.

And the fourth generation will return here;
that not until the iniquity of the Amorite is complete here.

And the sun was come 
and darkness was,
and behold, a furnace smoking 
and a torch of fire 
which passed between these pieces.

In the day that He-Who-Is (YHWH) cut Exalted-Father (Abram) a covenant,
saying, "To your seed I have given the land this,
from The River of Double-Narrows (Egypt) 
until The River, The Great, the River of Fruitful (Euphrates)."
