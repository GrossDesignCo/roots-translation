And a man went from the house of Joined (Levi), 
and took a daughter of Joined (Levi).

And the woman conceived 
and birthed a son, 
and she saw him, that he was good, 
and she concealed him three moon-cycles.

And she was able not further to conceal him, 
she took to him an ark of papyrus, 
and coated it in bitumen and in pitch, 
and placed in it the child, 
and set it in the reeds over the lip of the canal.

And his sister positioned-herself from a distance, 
to know what would be made to him.

And the child grew, and she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh, and he was to her for a son, 
and she called his name Drawn-Out (Moses), and said, "That from the waters I drew-him-out."
