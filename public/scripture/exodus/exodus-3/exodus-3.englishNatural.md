And Drawn-Out (Moses) had been shepherding the flock of Abundance (Jethro) his father-in-law, the priest of Strife (Midian), 
and he drove the flock after the wilderness, 
and came to the mountain of the God, Desolate (Horeb).

And the Messenger of He-Who-Is (YHWH) was-seen to him in a flame of fire, from the midst of the thornbush, 
and he saw, and behold the thornbush, burning in fire, 
and the thornbush was not consumed.

And Drawn-Out (Moses) said, "I will turn-aside please, 
and see this great sight, why the thornbush burns not."

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) saw that he had turned-aside to see, 
and God called to him from the midst of the thornbush 
and said, "Drawn-Out (Moses), Drawn-Out (Moses)," 
and he said, "Behold-me."

And he said, "Approach here not, 
send-out your sandals from over your feet, 
that the place which you, standing over it, the ground of holiness it is.

And he said, "I, the God of your father, 
the God of Exalted-Father (Abraham), 
the God of He-Laughs (Isaac), 
and the God of Heel-Grasper (Jacob)."

And Drawn-Out (Moses) hid his face, that he feared to look to the God.

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said, 
"Seeing, I have seen the affliction of my people which, in Double-Narrows (Egypt), 
and their outcry I have heard from the faces of his taskmasters, 
that I have known his pains.

And Drawn-Out (Moses) said to the God, "Behold I, coming to the sons of Struggles-with-God (Israel), and will have said to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' 
and they have said to me, 'What is his name?' what will I say to them?"

And God said to Drawn-Out (Moses), 
"I am which I am." 
And he said, "Thus you will say to the sons of Struggles-with-God (Israel), 
'I-Am has sent me to you.'"

And again God said to Drawn-Out (Moses), 
"Thus you will say to the sons of Struggles-with-God (Israel), 
'He-Who-Is (YHWH), God of your fathers, 
the God of Father-of-Multitudes (Abraham), 
the God of He-Laughs (Isaac), 
and the God of Heel-Grasper (Jacob), 
has sent me to you;' 
this is my name to the-age, 
and this is my rememberance to generation of generation."
