And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to Drawn-Out (Moses), 
"Again one touch I will bring over Pharaoh and over Double-Narrows (Egypt), 
after so he will send-out you from this, 
as his sending-out, finishing, banishing he will banish you from this.

Speak please in the ears of the people, 
and let ask a man from his friend and a woman from her friend vessels of silver and vessels of gold."

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) gave grace to the people in the eyes of Double-Narrows (Egypt), 
also the man Drawn-Out (Moses) great very in the land of Double-Narrows (Egypt), 
in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh and in the eyes of the people.

And Drawn-Out (Moses) said, "Thus has said He-Who-Is (YHWH), 
as the halving of the night I will bring-out in the midst of Double-Narrows (Egypt)."

And will die all firstborn in the land of Double-Narrows (Egypt), 
from the firstborn of Pharaoh the one sitting over his throne, 
until the firstborn of the maidservant which, after the millstones, 
and all the firstborn of beast.

And a great cry will be in all the land of Double-Narrows (Egypt), 
which like it was not, 
and like it will add not."

And to all the sons of Struggles-With-God (Israel) a dog will sharpen not his tongue, from man and until beast, for the sake of you will know which He-Who-Is (YHWH) will distinguish between Double-Narrows (Egypt) and between Struggles-With-God (Israel).

And all these your servants will go-down to me, 
and will bow-down to me, saying, 
'Go-out you and all the people which, in your feet.' 
and after so I will bring-out."

And he brought-out from with Pharaoh in burning nose.

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to Drawn-Out (Moses), 
"Pharaoh will hear not to you, 
for the sake of multiplying my wonders in the land of Double-Narrows (Egypt)."

And Drawn-Out (Moses) and Aaron made all these, the wonders, to the face of Pharaoh; 
and He-Who-Is (YHWH) strengthened the heart of Pharaoh, 
and he sent-out not the sons of Struggles-With-God (Israel) from his land.
