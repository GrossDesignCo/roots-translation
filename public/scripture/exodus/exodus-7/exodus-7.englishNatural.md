And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to Drawn-Out (Moses), 
"See, I have given you, God to Pharaoh; 
and Light-Bringer (Aaron) your brother, will be your prophet."

You will speak all which I command you; 
and Light-Bringer (Aaron) your brother will speak to Pharaoh 
and he will send-out the sons of Struggles-with-God (Israel) from his land."

And I will cause to harden the heart of Pharaoh, 
and I will cause to multiply my signs 
and my wonders in the land of Double-Narrows (Egypt)."

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to Drawn-Out (Moses), 
and to Light-Bringer (Aaron), saying,

"That Pharaoh will speak to you saying, 'Give to you a wonder,' 
and you will say to Light-Bringer (Aaron), 'Take your branch 
and throw it to the face of Pharaoh,' 
let it be to a monster."

And Drawn-Out (Moses) and Light-Bringer (Aaron) came to Pharaoh, 
and they did so, as which He-Who-Is (YHWH) had commanded; 
and Light-Bringer (Aaron) threw his branch to the face of Pharaoh 
and to the face of his servants, 
and it was to a monster.

And Pharaoh called-out also, to the wise and to the sorcerers; 
and the magicians of Double-Narrows (Egypt), they also made so, in their bright-flashes.

And man threw his branch, 
and they were to monsters; 
and the branch of Light-Bringer (Aaron) swallowed their branches.

And the heart of Pharaoh intensified, 
and he heard not to them; 
as which He-Who-Is (YHWH) had spoken.
