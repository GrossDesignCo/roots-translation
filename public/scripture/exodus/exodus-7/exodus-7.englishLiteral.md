And-said He_Who_Is (YHWH) to- Drawn_Out (Moses) "see I-give-you Gods to-Pharaoh; and-Light_Bringer (Aaron) brother-your will-be prophet-your."

you will-speak ↳ all- which I-command-you; and-Light_Bringer (Aaron) brother-your will-speak to- Pharaoh and-he-will-send_out ↳ sons-of Struggles_with_God (Israel) from-land-his."

And-I I-will-cause-to-harden ↳ heart-of Pharaoh and-I-will-cause-to-multiply ↳ signs-my and-↳ wonders-my in-land-of Double_Narrows (Egypt)."

And-said He_Who_Is (YHWH) to- Drawn_Out (Moses) and-to- Light_Bringer (Aaron) to-say:

"that will-speak to-you Pharaoh to-say give to-you wonder; and-will-say to- Light_Bringer (Aaron) take ↳ branch-your and-throw-him to-faces-of- Pharaoh let-him-be to-monster."

And-came Drawn_Out (Moses) and-Light_Bringer (Aaron) to- Pharaoh and-they-did so as-which he-commanded He_Who_Is (YHWH); and-threw Light_Bringer (Aaron) ↳ branch-his to-faces-of Pharaoh and-to-faces-of servants-his and-he-was to-monster.

And-called_out also- Pharaoh to-the-wise and-to-the-sorcerers; and-made also- they magicians-of Double_Narrows (Egypt) in-bright_flashes-their so.

And-threw man branch-his and-they-were to-monsters; 
and-swallowed branch-of- Light_Bringer (Aaron) ↳ branches-their.

And-intensified heart-of Pharaoh 
and-not heard to-them, as-which spoke He_Who_Is (YHWH).
