And Drawn-Out (Moses) answered and said, 
"And behold, they will believe me not, 
and they will hear not my voice, 
that they will say, 'He-Who-Is (YHWH) was-seen not to you.'"

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to him, "What is this in your hand?" 
And he said, "A branch."

And he said, "throw it to the land." 
And he threw it to the land, 
and it was a snake, 
and Drawn-Out (Moses) fled from its face.

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to Drawn-Out (Moses), 
"Send-out your hand and seize its tail." 
And he sent-out his hand and handled it, 
and it was a branch in his palm.

"For their sake they will believe that he was-seen to you, 
He-Who-Is (YHWH), the God of their fathers, 
the God of Exalted-Father (Abraham), 
the God of He-Laughs (Isaac), 
and the God of Heel-Grasper (Jacob)."

And Drawn-Out (Moses) took his woman and his sons, and caused them to ride over the donkey, 
and returned to the land of Double-Narrows (Egypt), 
and Drawn-Out (Moses) took the branch of the God in his hand.

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to Drawn-Out (Moses), "In your going, to return to Double-Narrows (Egypt), 
see all the wonders which I have placed in your hand and make them to the face of Pharaoh, 
but I will intensify his heart and he will send-out not the people."."
