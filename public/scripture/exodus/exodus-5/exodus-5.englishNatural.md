And after Drawn-Out (Moses) and Light-Bringer (Aaron) came and said to Pharaoh, 
"Thus has said He-Who-Is (YHWH), the God of Struggles-with-God (Israel), 
'Send-out my people and they will feast to me in the wilderness.'"

And Pharaoh said, "Who is He-Who-Is (YHWH) 
which I will hear in his voice 
to send-out Struggles-with-God (Israel)? 
I have known not He-Who-Is (YHWH), 
and also Struggles-with-God (Israel) I will send-out not."

And they said, "The God of the Passes-Through (Hebrews) was called-out over us, 
we will go please, a way of three days in Wilderness, 
and we will sacrifice to He-Who-Is (YHWH) our God, 
or else he strike-down us in the plague or in the sword."

And the king of Double-Narrows (Egypt) said to them, 
"Why, Drawn-Out (Moses) and Light-Bringer (Aaron), 
will you cause to let-loose the people from their works? 
Go to your burdens."

And Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land, now many, and you cause them to sabbath from their burdens."
