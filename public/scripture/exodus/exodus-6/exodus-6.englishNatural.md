And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to Drawn-Out (Moses), 
"Now you will see which I will do to Pharaoh; 
that in an intense hand he will send-out them 
and in an intense hand he will drive-out them from his land."

And God spoke to Drawn-Out (Moses) 
and said to him, "I, He-Who-Is (YHWH).

And I was-seen to Exalted-Father (Abraham), to He-Laughs (Isaac), 
and to Heel-Grasper (Jacob), in God Almighty, 
and my name He-Who-Is (YHWH) was known not to them."

Therefore say to the sons of Struggles-with-God (Israel), 
"I, He-Who-Is (YHWH), 
and I will bring-out you from under the burdens of Double-Narrows (Egypt), 
and I will deliver you from their service, 
and I will redeem you in a stretched-out arm and in great justices."
