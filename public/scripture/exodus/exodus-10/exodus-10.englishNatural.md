And He-Who-Is (YHWH) intensified the heart of Pharaoh, 
and he sent-out not the sons of Struggles-with-God (Israel).

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to Drawn-Out (Moses), 
"Stretch-out your hand over the skies 
and let it be darkness over the land of Double-Straits (Egypt) 
and let it feel darkness."

And Drawn-Out (Moses) stretched-out his hand over the skies; 
and it was darkness of gloom in all the land of Double-Straits (Egypt) three days.

Man saw not his brother, 
and man stood-up not from his lowness three days; 
and to all the sons of Struggles-with-God (Israel) it had been light in their seats.

And Pharaoh called-out to Drawn-Out (Moses) and said, 
"Go serve He-Who-Is (YHWH); 
only your flock and your herd let be stationed: 
also your little ones let go with you."

And Drawn-Out (Moses) said, 
"Also you will give in our hand sacrifices and ascending-offerings 
and will make to He-Who-Is (YHWH) our God."

And also our livestock will go with us; 
not will remain a hoof; 
for from it we will take to serve He-Who-Is (YHWH) our God; 
and we not we know with what we will serve He-Who-Is (YHWH) 
until we come there.

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) intensified, the heart of Pharaoh, 
and he was willing not to send-out them.

And Pharaoh said to him, 
"Go from over me,
guard yourself,
add not to see my face,
that in the day of you seeing my face, you will die."

And Drawn-Out (Moses) said, 
"So you have spoken, 
I will add not again to see your face."
